I am a PhD candidate at the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech. I work at the [Synergy Lab](http://synergy.cs.vt.edu/) under supervision of Dr. [Wu-chun Feng](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~feng/). 

I am broadly interested in high-performance computing (HPC), computer architecture, and compilers with emphasis on program analysis and transformation to make efficient use of heterogeneous parallel architectures. During my PhD research, I worked with Dr. [Wu-chun Feng](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~feng/), [Changhee Jung](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chjung/), and [Yasser Hanafy](https://www.aast.edu/cv.php?disp_unit=&ser=11625) on novel automation frameworks for performance analysis and runtime adaptation using graph-structured program representations.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I received my MSc. and BSc. degrees in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Cairo University. In the professional world, I worked on the research and development of various computing systems, ranging from wearable devices, to cyber-physical systems, to HPC clusters. More recently, I worked at the Intel Parallel Computing Lab on performance analysis and modeling of emerging machine learning applications on a large-scale specialized platform for compute-intensive workloads. At AMD research, I worked on 
advanced runtime support for fine-grained interdependent tasks to improving the performance of irregular applications on GPUs.
